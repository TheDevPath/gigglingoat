Let's start out by generating a new scrypto package so that we can set up our meme token blueprints.

1. Open up the integrated terminal and run `scrypto new-package blueprints`
   > This will create a new folder named blueprints you can of course name it whatever you prefer.

> Inside this folder will be the boiler plate project to get our meme token blueprints started.

2. Open up the `blueprints/src/lib.rs` and then delete eveything.

3. Add `mod MemeToken` at the top and save

4. In the src folder create a new file named `MemeToken.rs`

> The file should be open upon creation start typing blueprint then select the blueprint snippet from the hint autocomplete popup.

5. At the first snippet tab stop name the struct & impl `MemeToken` name the rest whatever you want.
